## Overview
I create an app that will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

## How it Works
- When you run the application it will disply items for purchase.
- The application will then promp you to select the item ID for the item you would like to purchase. 
- If you would like to exit this application and not make a purchase you can press E.
- Once you enter in the ID the application will then promt you to input the number of items you would like to purchase. 
- If there is enough in stock the application will let you know that your purchse was successful and take out the quanity from the stock. 
- If there is not enough in stock the application will notify you and reoload the items for you to re-select.
